A question will only show in widget, to all visitors, when a response exists. 2. Visitors can always see their own questions, even if unanswered. 3. When you respond to a question the first time, the person who asked the question gets a quick little email notification, so they can come and check out your response! Why don‚Äôt you ask us a question here, and we‚Äôll respond!? Nothing like the real thing‚Ä¶',

         'answer': 'Just about anybody that likes people coming to their websites! Like us. Are you content-marketer? Do you run an e-com store? Do you have a SaaS landing page? You have probably worked hard to get someone to land on your website or store. Your best customers are the ones that want to ask you tons of questions.With hagrid you can get every one of those questions to make your page more effective for the next visitor.',

        {'id': '4', 'question': 'What is hagrid exactly?',
         'answer': 'hagrid is ‚Äúwidget‚Äù, just like this one, that you can add to any webpage! In the widget, visitors can ask questions, and we (the website owners) can respond. The questions and answers are public (unlike customer-support e-mails and chat, which are gathering dust in your attic). So with hagrid you get two big advantages: 1. Social proof & the resulting trust - see and hear other people ‚Äúin the room‚Äù 2. A living breathing FAQ section - populated by your users A good parallel is the questions and answers section on an amazon.com product listing.',

         'answer': 'Hey Aravind! The answer to your question is up in the wind really, but all this seem to suggest that I am about 94 years old and a bit. If you want to know about the company/product, we are a two year old company, and hagrid is relatively young project, that just now put into open beta.',

        {'id': '8', 'question': 'If someone trolls this section can you remove their question?',
         'answer': 'Hey Isaac, I really want to remove this question to show you that we can. But then, that looks like a circular loop, that would be a paradox! Jokes apart: 1. Questions go live (for the world) when responded to. 2. Can be removed if needed. We think the world is civil enough for that!',

         'answer': 'We are bit embarrassed about how little of our roadmap we have built, and how much we have learnt in feedback from fine folks such as yourself. We\'ll put this together and share with you shortly. And once we have this in place, we will reach out to ask you what we should change. We\'re in it to build it!',

         'answer': 'We have nearly endless customisation for the widget, so you can make it look just right on your website: fonts, colors, backgrounds, even the rounded corners! And you can change the style of the answers (accordion, always open...), language (if you don\'t see your language, just let us know, we\'ll add it in 15 minutes).',

         'answer': 'Actually you don\'t have to wait till questions get repetitive. We have search-as-you-type, in the question entry box, that will show you suggestions from public questions that might resolve your query without the need to ask a fresh question. This works as soon as you have 1 question that matches.',

        {'id': '14', 'question': 'How is this different from a comments box?',
         'answer': 'Hi Joey, hagrid can of course be used as a "powerful" comments box. While there are a lot of things we do that a "comments box" would not, here are my top 3 favourites:1. Reach your users after they have left your website, so they can see your responses2. Auto-search questions while you are typing so people can see a past response3. Embed rich content, like YouTube videos, Tweets and images',
